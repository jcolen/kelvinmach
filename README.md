Official repository for the paper **Kelvin-Froude wake patterns of a traveling pressure disturbance** (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01884>).

The programs for the challenging kelvin research problem are located in the challenging\_kelvin folder, along with some pictures in the pics/ subfolder.

challenging\_kelvin.py can be run standalone with the command

    python challenging_kelvin.py <lambda> <kmax>[default=64]

The (messy) programs for the old research on the kelvin-mach wake are located in the kelvin\_mach folder, along with some pictures in the phi/ subfolder. These are very disorganized but are included as a general reference.
